# File Comparator (First OOP Project 🚀)

This is my first project using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python.  
The script compares two files by calculating and comparing their **hash values** (default: SHA-256).

## 📌 Features
- Calculate hash of a file (SHA-256 by default)
- Compare two files based on their hashes
- Uses `FileHasser` and `FileComparator` classes for better structure

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/code-pablo/python-oop-file-hasher.git

   cd file-comparator
